# The Investment Process: A Complete Guide

## Overview

The investment process is a structured, repeatable workflow that transforms financial goals into actionable portfolio decisions. This document outlines each phase, from initial goal-setting through ongoing portfolio management.

## Phase 1: Define Goals and Objectives

**Timeline: Week 1**

Every investment journey begins with clearly defined goals:

- **Time Horizon**: Short-term (1-3 years), medium-term (3-10 years), or long-term (10+ years)
- **Return Target**: Expected annual return (e.g., 7-10% for growth, 3-5% for income)
- **Risk Tolerance**: Conservative, moderate, or aggressive
- **Capital Available**: Initial investment amount and planned contributions
- **Purpose**: Retirement, education, home purchase, wealth building

Key deliverable: A written Investment Policy Statement (IPS) documenting all goals, constraints, and preferences.

## Phase 2: Research and Analysis

**Timeline: Weeks 2-3**

Conduct thorough research across multiple dimensions:

### Market Analysis
- Macroeconomic indicators (GDP growth, inflation, interest rates)
- Market cycles and current positioning (expansion, peak, contraction, trough)
- Sector trends and rotation patterns
- Geopolitical factors affecting markets

### Asset Class Evaluation
- Equities: domestic large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap, international, emerging markets
- Fixed Income: government bonds, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, high-yield
- Alternatives: real estate (REITs), commodities, private equity
- Cash equivalents: money market funds, certificates of deposit

### Security Selection Criteria
- Fundamental analysis: earnings growth, revenue trends, profit margins, debt levels
- Valuation metrics: P/E ratio, P/B ratio, dividend yield, free cash flow yield
- Technical analysis: price trends, moving averages, support/resistance levels
- Quality factors: management track record, competitive moat, ESG considerations

## Phase 3: Asset Allocation

**Timeline: Week 4**

Design the portfolio structure based on research findings:

### Strategic Allocation (Long-term targets)
- Growth Portfolio: 80% equities, 15% fixed income, 5% alternatives
- Balanced Portfolio: 60% equities, 30% fixed income, 10% alternatives
- Conservative Portfolio: 30% equities, 55% fixed income, 15% alternatives

### Tactical Allocation (Short-term adjustments)
- Overweight sectors showing momentum
- Underweight overvalued asset classes
- Maintain cash reserve (2-5%) for opportunities

### Diversification Rules
- No single stock exceeds 5% of portfolio
- No single sector exceeds 25% of portfolio
- Geographic diversification: at least 20% international exposure
- Minimum 3 asset classes represented

## Phase 4: Execution

**Timeline: Week 5**

Implement the investment plan through disciplined execution:

### Order Strategy
- Use limit orders for individual securities
- Dollar-cost averaging for large positions (split into 3-4 tranches)
- Implement tax-efficient placement (tax-advantaged accounts for bonds, taxable for equities)

### Account Structure
- Tax-advantaged accounts: 401(k), IRA, Roth IRA for long-term holdings
- Taxable brokerage: for shorter-term positions and tax-loss harvesting
- Emergency fund: 3-6 months expenses in high-yield savings

### Transaction Checklist
1. Verify order details (symbol, quantity, price, order type)
2. Check available cash/margin
3. Confirm alignment with target allocation
4. Place order during optimal market hours
5. Document trade rationale

## Phase 5: Monitoring

**Timeline: Ongoing (weekly/monthly reviews)**

Continuously track portfolio performance and market conditions:

### Performance Metrics
- Total return (capital gains + dividends)
- Risk-adjusted return (Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio)
- Benchmark comparison (S&P 500, 60/40 blend, custom benchmark)
- Maximum drawdown tracking

### Review Schedule
- Daily: Check for significant market events or news affecting holdings
- Weekly: Review portfolio value and any triggered alerts
- Monthly: Detailed performance report and allocation drift check
- Quarterly: Comprehensive review against IPS objectives

### Alert Triggers
- Position exceeds 7% of portfolio (concentration risk)
- Asset class drifts more than 5% from target
- Individual holding drops more than 15% from purchase price
- Market volatility (VIX) exceeds 30

## Phase 6: Rebalancing

**Timeline: Quarterly or when drift thresholds are exceeded**

Restore portfolio alignment through systematic rebalancing:

### Rebalancing Methods
- Calendar-based: Fixed quarterly schedule (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct)
- Threshold-based: Trigger when allocation drifts 5%+ from target
- Hybrid: Quarterly review with threshold triggers between reviews

### Tax-Efficient Rebalancing
- Use new contributions to fill underweight positions first
- Harvest tax losses in taxable accounts (wash sale rule: 30 days)
- Rebalance within tax-advantaged accounts to avoid taxable events
- Consider charitable giving of appreciated securities

### Rebalancing Workflow
1. Calculate current allocation vs. target allocation
2. Identify positions to trim (overweight) and add (underweight)
3. Prioritize tax-efficient methods
4. Execute trades
5. Document changes and rationale
6. Update performance tracking

## Key Metrics Summary

| Metric | Conservative | Balanced | Growth |
|--------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Expected Return | 4-6% | 6-8% | 8-12% |
| Max Drawdown | -10% | -20% | -35% |
| Volatility (Std Dev) | 5-8% | 10-14% | 15-20% |
| Income Yield | 3-4% | 2-3% | 1-2% |
| Rebalance Frequency | Quarterly | Quarterly | Semi-annual |

## Investment Process Flow

```
Define Goals --> Research --> Allocate --> Execute --> Monitor --> Rebalance
     ^                                                              |
     |______________________________________________________________|
                        (Continuous Improvement Cycle)
```

Each phase builds on the previous one, creating a disciplined and repeatable process that removes emotion from investment decisions and maintains focus on long-term objectives.
